## Project 1: 🚔 Examining Use of Force by the Metropolitan Police Service

- **🎯 Aim:** Inform future policies by analyzing variables related to the use of force by Metropolitan Police Service.
- **🔍 Research Questions:**
  1. Which characteristics explain odds of using different types of force? What are their directions and magnitudes?
  2. Can subject behavior be predicted before an encounter using 'foreknowledge'?
  3. Are there seasonal patterns in non-compliant encounters? Can they be predicted accurately using time-series modelling?
- **🔧 Methods:**
  - Inference-focused multi-level (hierarchical) logistic regression
  - XGBoost and ElasticNet logistic regression multi-class classifiers
  - Deep learning neural networks (Feedforward, Recurrent and Transformer-encoded)
  - MySQL database hosted in cloud
- **📊 Data Sources:**
  - Use-of-force forms data
  - Street crime statistics 
  - Official UK Census 2021

## Project 2: 📈 Predicting Twitter Engagement using Text Data Mining

- **🎯 Aim:** Employ TDM techniques to analyze tweets and predict the engagement metrics.
- **🔍 Methodology:**
  - Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Feature engineering with a focus on text-derived features.
  - Sentiment analysis.
  - Utilization of Gradient Boosting Trees and Ridge Regularized Linear Regression models for predictive modeling.
  - Hyperparameter optimization for fine-tuning the models.
- **📊 Results:**
  - The Gradient Boosting model demonstrates superior performance, explaining 47.1% of the variability ($R^2$) in likes count.
  - Noteworthy insights are derived from feature importance analysis, emphasizing factors such as word choice, character usage, and timing of tweet publication.
- **📝 Recommendations:**
  - Tailored recommendations provided to optimize engagement.
  - Strategies include curating tweet content, managing character usage, timing publication strategically, and incorporating specific keywords for enhanced visibility and interaction.

## Project 3: 🏭 Multiobjective Line Balancing in Manufacturing

- **🎯 Aim:** Optimize assembly line design by balancing tasks across workstations to meet production goals while considering economic, social, and environmental factors.
- **🔍 Description:**
  - The project revolves around optimizing the assembly line design for a manufacturer. This involves sequencing 30 tasks based on a precedence diagram, each with specific processing times and tool requirements. The goal is to ensure that one unit of the product is assembled every 40 seconds (takt time) while adhering to precedence constraints.
  - The project employs a multiobjective approach, considering economic, social, and environmental objectives. The economic objective focuses on minimizing the number of workstations, which translates to lower labor and space costs. The social objective aims to maximize operator workload smoothness, enhancing fairness and reducing ergonomic risks. The environmental objective targets the reduction of cordless power tool usage, thereby minimizing hazardous materials.
- **🔧 Methods:**
  - Global search using Genetic Algorithm (GA)
  - Local search for iterative improvement
  - Incorporation of takt time, precedence constraints, task time, and tool requirements
