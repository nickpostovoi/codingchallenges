## Project 1: 🚔 Examining Use of Force by the Metropolitan Police Service

- **🎯 Aim:** Inform future policies by analyzing variables related to the use of force by Metropolitan Police Service.
- **🔍 Research Questions:**
  1. Which characteristics explain odds of using different types of force? What are their directions and magnitudes?
  2. Can subject behavior be predicted before an encounter using 'foreknowledge'?
  3. Are there seasonal patterns in non-compliant encounters? Can they be predicted accurately using time-series modelling?
- **🔧 Methods:**
  - Inference-focused multi-level (hierarchical) logistic regression
  - XGBoost and ElasticNet logistic regression multi-class classifiers
  - Deep learning neural networks (Feedforward, Recurrent and Transformer-encoded)
  - MySQL database hosted in cloud
- **📊 Data Sources:**
  - Use-of-force forms data
  - Street crime statistics 
  - Official UK Census 2021

## Project 2: 📈 Predicting Twitter Engagement Using Textual Data

- **🎯 Aim:**
  - Employ machine learning techniques to analyze Donald Trump's tweets and predict the engagement metrics.
  - Text analysis is a key component of this project.
- **🔍 Methodology:**
  - Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing, including the removal of retweets, URLs, and special characters.
  - Feature engineering with a focus on text-derived features (e.g. word count, character usage, tokenization, sentiment analysis and many others).
  - Utilization of Gradient Boosting Trees and Ridge Regularized Linear Regression models for predictive modeling.
  - Hyperparameter optimization for fine-tuning the models.
- **📊 Results:**
  - The Gradient Boosting model demonstrates superior performance, explaining 47.1% of the variability (R^2) in likes count.
  - Noteworthy insights are derived from feature importance analysis, emphasizing factors such as word choice, character usage, and timing of tweet publication.
- **📝 Recommendations:**
  - Tailored recommendations provided to optimize engagement.
  - Strategies include curating tweet content, managing character usage, timing publication strategically, and incorporating specific keywords for enhanced visibility and interaction.
